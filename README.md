# Tic Tac Toe CNC Router

This is some code that turn my cnc router into a tic tac toe robot. It uses a marker where the router bit would usally go to draw the board. Then by using a camera and computer vision it finds where you moved. After that, it decided what the optimal move would be and draws an X there.
